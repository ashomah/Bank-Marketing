This project analyses a **bank marketing campaign history** and predicts **which customers are likely to subscribe to a bank term deposit**. The original dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/henriqueyamahata/bank-marketing).  

All the files of this project are saved in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ashomah/Bank-Marketing).

#### Report Formats  

The report of this analysis comes in three formats:  

* **GitHub Markdown**: to be easily read on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ashomah/Bank-Marketing).  
* **HTML**: to be consulted in a web browser and/or printed.  
* **Shiny App**: to add interactivity and provide enhanced readability.

#### For developers  

To visualize the Rmarkdown in your web browser and see any update on saving, `cd` to the directory and use this command in Terminal:  
`Rscript -e 'rmarkdown::run("Bank-Marketing-Report.Rmd", shiny_args = list(launch.browser = TRUE))'`
